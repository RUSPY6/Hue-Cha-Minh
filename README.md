# **Huế Chả Minh**
___
### Welcome To The Jungle!
Huế Chả Minh is a Take n' Hold character that makes full utilization of the diverse weaponry and equipment used in the Indochina/Vietnam conflicts via vanilla and modded content.
##### Lootpools
Instead of a single lootpool for each category of equipment, lootpools are instead split into 2 master categories: equipment used by the Pathet-Lao, Viet-Minh, Viet-Cong, etc. (either produced themselves, or captured/supplied by other means), and equipment that the US/ARVN/ANZAC/NATO forces have deployed in the conflicts. Each faction's lootpools can be identified in the Take n' Hold shop with the former factions being red, and the latter blue. Equipment used can be designed and produced as early as the 1870s, to as late as the latter half of the 1970s. You'll be pressed to come across fancy tupperware, so expect surplus and wooden furniture!
##### Balancing
***Infinite Ammo & 5 Holds is strongly recommended***; Limited Ammo or Endless have not been balanced.
