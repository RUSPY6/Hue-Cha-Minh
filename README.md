# **Hue Cha Minh**

## Welcome To The Jungle!
Hue Cha Minh, or HCM for short, is a H3VR Take n' Hold character that fully utilizes the diverse weaponry and equipment used in the Indochina/Vietnam conflicts via vanilla and modded content!

## Features
HCM has been designed from the ground up to be a fun, challenging, and historically authentic character while still maintaining an entertaining balance, via:
- Providing two unique progressions for the player to choose from, of which include:
  - "Main Progression", the meat and potatoes of HCM, differentiating the various nuances of the featured weaponry via faction-based equipment pools
  - "Lite Progression" with a more arcadey and simplified equipment pool system, akin to the vanilla Wieners Through Time characters
- Extensive support for other era-appropriate community-made mods
- Support for Endless and Limited Ammo modes
- Unique enemy Sosig variants, ranging from simple grunts with surplus weaponry, to deadly Grenadiers and Combat Engineers armed with Grenade Launchers and Flamethrowers, respectively
